# Dotnet-data-querying-scenarios
Real-world data querying scenarios in C# using LINQ across multi-entity domain models

This repository demonstrates advanced data querying scenarios using C# and LINQ,
built on a structured domain model with multiple related entities.

The project simulates real-world backend data operations involving
users, orders, products, categories, and relationships between them.

## Domain Model
- Person
- Order (one-to-many with Person)
- OrderItem (one-to-many with Order)
- Product
- Category (many-to-many with Product)

## Concepts Covered
- Filtering and projections
- Grouping and aggregations
- Complex joins
- One-to-many relationships
- Many-to-many relationships
- Nested queries
- Ordering and paging
- Real-world business query scenarios

## Technologies
- C#
- .NET
- LINQ

This project focuses on strengthening data querying and domain modeling skills
commonly required in backend development.
